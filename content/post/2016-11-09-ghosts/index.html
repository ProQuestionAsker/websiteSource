<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my second-ever Kaggle competition (looking for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/titanic/predicting-survival-on-the-titanic">first</a>?) I’ll do my best to walk through my thought-process here and welcome any comments on my work. Let’s get started!</p>

<h3>Loading Necessary Packages</h3>
<pre class="r"><code># For data manipulation and tidying

<h3>Importing Data</h3>
<p>The data were downloaded directly from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/data">Kaggle Website</a>. Before binding the training and test sets into a single data file, I added a column called “Dataset” and labelled rows from the training file “train” and rows from the testing file “test”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;train.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
train$Dataset &lt;- &quot;train&quot;

test &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;test.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test$Dataset &lt;- &quot;test&quot;

<p>Great! So here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p>We have 8 variables currently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ID</strong> : Appears to be the identification number of the monster in question</li>
<li><strong>Bone Length</strong> : Average length of the bones in the creature, normalized to 0 - 1</li>
<li><strong>Rotting Flesh</strong> : Percentage of flesh on the creature that is rotting</li>
<li><strong>Hair Length</strong> : Average length of the hair on the creature, normalized from 0 - 1</li>
<li><strong>Has Soul</strong> : The percentage of a soul present in the creature</li>
<li><strong>Color</strong> : The color of the creature</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong> : The category of the creature (i.e. ghoul, goblin or ghost)</li>
<li><strong>Dataset</strong> : The column I added when importing data indicating whether the observation was part of the original training or test set</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like a few of these variables would serve better as factors, rather than character strings, so I’ll take care of that.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at what we’ve got here so far. What’s the distribution of each variable across each monster?</p>
<p>Let’s first temporarily remove the “test” rows.</p>

<h3>Distinguishing Features?</h3>
<p>Hmm, looks like ghosts have shorter hair and fewer pieces of soul than ghouls and goblins, but otherwise are pretty close. Ghouls and goblins are going to be tricky to distinguish. Color doesn’t appear to help a whole lot as there seems to be a pretty even distribution to these multi-colored critters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="feature-engineering" class="section level2">
<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
<p>Normally here I would try to come up with additional ways to look at these data, but we can’t infer the size of the creature since both bone and hair length have been normalized. As of now, I can’t think of any features worth engineering from the current data.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m missing some interesting connection between variables?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pairs(full[, 2:5], col = full$type, labels = c(&quot;Bone Length&quot;, 
    &quot;Rotting Flesh&quot;, &quot;Hair Length&quot;, &quot;Soul&quot;))</code></pre>

<div class="figcaption">Matrix of overlapping dots showing little to no separation between ghosts, goblins, and ghouls based on bone length, rotting flesh, hair length, or soul percentage.</div>
</div>
<p>Nope. But perhaps we can take advantage of a combination of characteristics that do seem to show some promise: most notably “Hair Length” and “Soul”. Do we get any better separation among creatures if we combine these variables into one?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full &lt;- full %&gt;% mutate(hair_soul = hair_length * has_soul)</code></pre>
<div class="float">
<img src="unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" alt="Box and whisker plot showing that combining hair length and soul amount allows for a more clean separation of ghosts from goblins and ghouls." />
<div class="figcaption">Box and whisker plot showing that combining hair length and soul amount allows for a more clean separation of ghosts from goblins and ghouls.</div>
</div>
<p>That may have separated Ghosts a little further from the other two… Let’s try a few more variable interactions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full &lt;- full %&gt;% mutate(bone_flesh = bone_length * rotting_flesh, 
    bone_hair = bone_length * hair_length, bone_soul = bone_length * 
        has_soul, flesh_hair = rotting_flesh * hair_length, flesh_soul = rotting_flesh * 
        has_soul)</code></pre>
<p>Time to check for ways to tidy up.</p>

<p>The only column that has any missing values is <code>type</code> which is to be expected since that’s what we need to be predicting. Everything else seems to look good so far. Let’s try to model these as is.</p>
</div>
<div id="clustering-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Clustering data</h2>
<p>While clustering is generally used for unsupervised machine learning, I want to take a peek at the clusters that could be formed using the data at hand. The potential issue with trying to cluster this data is that we are working with two types of data: continuous and categorical. They break down like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Continuous Variables</th>
<th>Categorical Variables</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>bone length</td>
<td>id</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>rotting flesh</td>
<td>color</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>hair length</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>has soul</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, sure, there’s only two categorical variables. Because of our small sample size, it’s not a good idea to count out these variables completely, but we’ll try to create clusters without them just to see how well the clustering models do.</p>
<div id="cluster-without-categorical-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Cluster Without Categorical Variables</h3>
<p>I’ll first try to cluster using the <code>kmeans</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set the seed
set.seed(100)

# Extract creature labels and remove column from dataset
creature_labels &lt;- full$type
full2 &lt;- full
full2$type &lt;- NULL

# Remove categorical variables (id, color, and dataset) from
# dataset
full2$id &lt;- NULL
full2$color &lt;- NULL
full2$Dataset &lt;- NULL

# Perform k-means clustering with 3 clusters, repeat 30 times
creature_km_1 &lt;- kmeans(full2, 3, nstart = 30)</code></pre>
<p>Ok, so now we have clusters, time to see how well they did. Let’s look at them graphically first. This was created using the <code>plotcluster()</code> function from the <code>fpc</code> package.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" alt="Overlapping groups of red number 2s, green 3s, and black 1s" />
<div class="figcaption">Overlapping groups of red number 2s, green 3s, and black 1s</div>
</div>
<p>Hmm, those clusters don’t look very discrete. Let’s look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunn_index">Dunn’s Index</a> mathematically to see if we’re missing something visually. This calculation comes from the <code>dunn</code> function in the <code>clValid</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dunn_ckm_1 &lt;- dunn(clusters = creature_km_1$cluster, Data = full2)

# Print results
dunn_ckm_1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.04670431</code></pre>
<p>As Dunn’s Index represents a ratio of the smallest distance between clusters to the largest distance between two points in the same cluster (or, the smallest inter-cluster distance to the largest intra-cluster distance), such a low number indicates that our current clusters are not condensed, separate entities. This is not terribly surprising considering we completely disregarded one of our variables.</p>
<p>Let’s see how well this clustering method correctly separated the labelled creatures.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(creature_km_1$cluster, creature_labels)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    creature_labels
##     Ghost Ghoul Goblin
##   1     7    39     75
##   2     4    86     24
##   3   106     4     26</code></pre>
<p>It looks like currently, ghosts were separated relatively well, but ghouls and goblins are split between the clusters. Ok, I’m convinced. I haven’t really gained any new information here, but it’s been an interesting exploratory path!</p>
<p>On to supervised modeling!</p>
</div>
<div id="modeling-for-creature-identity" class="section level3">
<h3>Modeling for Creature Identity</h3>
<p>Clustering was not particularly helpful in discerning creature identity, so perhaps creating models will work better.</p>
<p>First things first, I need to split out the test and training data back into separate datasets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train_complete &lt;- full[full$Dataset == &quot;train&quot;, ]
test_complete &lt;- full[full$Dataset == &quot;test&quot;, ]</code></pre>
<p>Because I plan on using the <code>caret</code> package for all of my modeling, I’m going to generate a standard <code>trainControl</code> so that those tuning parameters remain consistent throughout the various models.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-traincontrol" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating trainControl</h3>
<p>I will create a system that will perform 20 repeats of a 10-Fold cross-validation of the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>myControl &lt;- trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 10, repeats = 20, 
    verboseIter = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="random-forest-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>Random Forest Modeling</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a random forest model, generated using the <code>ranger</code> and <code>caret</code> packages. I’m going to include all of the original variables, including any interactions here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(10)

rf_model &lt;- train(type ~ bone_length + rotting_flesh + hair_length + 
    has_soul + color + hair_soul + bone_flesh + bone_hair + bone_soul + 
    flesh_hair + flesh_soul, tuneLength = 3, data = train_complete, 
    method = &quot;ranger&quot;, trControl = myControl, importance = &quot;impurity&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the levels of importance of each factor in this model.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" alt="Bar graph showing that the combination of hair &amp; soul, combo of bone &amp; hair, and rotting flesh are the most influential on the model" />
<div class="figcaption">Bar graph showing that the combination of hair &amp; soul, combo of bone &amp; hair, and rotting flesh are the most influential on the model</div>
</div>
<p>Huh. Our “hair_soul” variable seems to be the most important to this model and our other interactions rank pretty highly. I suppose we can hold on to them for now. Color, on the other hand, hardly plays into this. Let’s try removing it from a second random forest model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(10)

rf_model_2 &lt;- train(type ~ bone_length + rotting_flesh + hair_length + 
    has_soul + hair_soul + bone_flesh + bone_hair + bone_soul + 
    flesh_hair + flesh_soul, tuneLength = 3, data = train_complete,

<div id="glmnet-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>GLMnet Modeling</h3>

<h2>Predicting Creature Identity</h2>
<p>Although I generated four models above, the second glmnet model (all interactions but without color) provided the highest accuracy, so I’ll use that model to predict survival in the test set.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Reorder the data by creature ID number
test_complete &lt;- test_complete %&gt;% arrange(id)

# Make predicted survival values
my_prediction &lt;- predict(glm_model_2, test_complete)</code></pre>

<h3>Preparing the prediction for Kaggle</h3>
<p>The instructions on Kaggle indicate that they are expecting a csv file with 2 columns: ID and Creature Type. I need to make sure that my data are arranged properly.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create a data frame with two columns
my_solution_GGG_03 &lt;- data.frame(id = test_complete$id, Type = my_prediction)

# Write the solution to a csv file
