<div id="the-premise" class="section level2">
<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>Probability can be a hard concept to understand, especially when discussing the probability of highly unlikely events. The original “infinite monkey theorem” posits that given an infinite amount of time, a monkey with a typewriter could eventually type out Shakespeare by randomly mashing keys. We wanted to create a visual explainer of this concept using a slightly different medium, keyboards aimed at playing well-known melodies. And using computers instead of monkeys.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Collaborators</h2>
<p>This story was in collaboration with The Pudding’s <a href="https://twitter.com/codenberg">Russell Goldenberg</a>. The idea was originally Russell’s but we worked together to figure out the best way to present the information and in bringing the story to life.</p>
