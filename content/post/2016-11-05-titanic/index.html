<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my first project on Kaggle and my first attempt at machine learning. I’ll do my best to illustrate what I’ve down and the logic behind my actions, but feedback is very much welcome and appreciated!</p>

<h3>Loading Necessary Packages</h3>
<pre class="r"><code># For data manipulation and tidying

<div id="importing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Importing Data</h3>
<p>The data were downloaded directly from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data">Kaggle Website</a>. Before binding the training and test sets into a single data file, I added a column called “Dataset” and labelled rows from the training file “train” and rows from the testing file “test”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;train.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
train$Dataset &lt;- &quot;train&quot;

test &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;test.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test$Dataset &lt;- &quot;test&quot;

full &lt;- bind_rows(train, test)</code></pre>
<p>The full dataset can then be inspected:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(full)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    1309 obs. of  13 variables:
##  $ PassengerId: int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ Survived   : int  0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 ...
##  $ Pclass     : int  3 1 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 2 ...
##  $ Name       : chr  &quot;Braund, Mr. Owen Harris&quot; &quot;Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer)&quot; &quot;Heikkinen, Miss. Laina&quot; &quot;Futrelle, Mrs. Jacques Heath (Lily May Peel)&quot; ...

##  $ Ticket     : chr  &quot;A/5 21171&quot; &quot;PC 17599&quot; &quot;STON/O2. 3101282&quot; &quot;113803&quot; ...

##  $ Embarked   : chr  &quot;S&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;S&quot; ...
##  $ Dataset    : chr  &quot;train&quot; &quot;train&quot; &quot;train&quot; &quot;train&quot; ...</code></pre>
<p>It appears that several of these variables should be represented as factors and thus should be reclassified.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>factor_variables &lt;- c(&quot;PassengerId&quot;, &quot;Survived&quot;, &quot;Pclass&quot;, &quot;Sex&quot;, 
    &quot;Embarked&quot;, &quot;Dataset&quot;)
full[factor_variables] &lt;- lapply(full[factor_variables], function(x) as.factor(x))</code></pre>
<p>We are now left with the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Passenger ID</strong> : A seemingly unique number assigned to each passenger</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Survived</strong> : A binary indicator of survival (0 = died, 1 = survived)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pclass</strong> : A proxy for socio-economic status (1 = upper, 3 = lower)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name</strong> : Passenger’s Name. For wedded women, her husband’s name appears first and her maiden name appears in parentheses</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sex</strong> : General indication of passenger’s sex</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Age</strong> : Age of passenger (or approximate age). Passengers under the age of 1 year have fractional ages</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SibSp</strong> : A count of the passenger’s siblings or spouses aboard</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parch</strong> : A count of the passenger’s parents or siblings aboard</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ticket</strong> : The number printed on the ticket. The numbering system is not immediately apparent</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fare</strong> : The price for the ticket (presumably in pounds, shillings, and pennies)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cabin</strong> : Cabin number occupied by the passenger (this field is quite empty)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Embarked</strong> : The port from which the passenger boarded the ship</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dataset</strong> : Whether this particular row was a part of the training or testing dataset</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Names and Titles</h3>
<p>At first glance, the “Name” column doesn’t help too much as there are 1307 unique names, however, this column also includes embedded title information that may be of interest. I decided to use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf">regular expressions</a> and the <code>gsub()</code> functions to extract the titles into a new variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names &lt;- full$Name

titles &lt;- gsub(&quot;^.*, (.*?)\\..*$&quot;, &quot;\\1&quot;, names)

full$Titles &lt;- titles

unique(full$Titles)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;Mr&quot;           &quot;Mrs&quot;          &quot;Miss&quot;         &quot;Master&quot;      
##  [5] &quot;Don&quot;          &quot;Rev&quot;          &quot;Dr&quot;           &quot;Mme&quot;         
##  [9] &quot;Ms&quot;           &quot;Major&quot;        &quot;Lady&quot;         &quot;Sir&quot;         
## [13] &quot;Mlle&quot;         &quot;Col&quot;          &quot;Capt&quot;         &quot;the Countess&quot;
## [17] &quot;Jonkheer&quot;     &quot;Dona&quot;</code></pre>
<p>That’s a bit more manageable: only 18 unique titles. Time to see how many times each title was used. I decided to make a table separated by sex.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(full$Sex, full$Title)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         
##          Capt Col Don Dona  Dr Jonkheer Lady Major Master Miss Mlle Mme
##   female    0   0   0    1   1        0    1     0      0  260    2   1
##   male      1   4   1    0   7        1    0     2     61    0    0   0
##         
##           Mr Mrs  Ms Rev Sir the Countess
##   female   0 197   2   0   0            1
##   male   757   0   0   8   1            0</code></pre>
<p>It looks like Captain, Don, Dona, Jonkheer, Lady, Madame, Sir and the Countess were each only used once. I’ll leave Captain separate, but the rest should be combined with similar categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don</strong> : A Spanish/Portuguese/Italian title used with, but not instead of, a name.</li>
<li><strong>Dona</strong> : Female version of “Don”</li>
<li><strong>Jonkheer</strong> : Dutch honorific of nobility</li>
<li><strong>Lady</strong> : English honorific of nobility</li>
<li><strong>Madame</strong> : French, polite form of address for a woman</li>
<li><strong>Sir</strong> : Honorific address (male)</li>
<li><strong>the Countess</strong> : Rank of nobility (female)</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that most of the rarely used titles indicate some form of nobility. That’s easy to check with another table comparing <code>Pclass</code> and <code>Titles</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(full$Pclass, full$Titles)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    
##     Capt Col Don Dona  Dr Jonkheer Lady Major Master Miss Mlle Mme  Mr Mrs
##   1    1   4   1    1   6        1    1     2      5   60    2   1 159  77
##   2    0   0   0    0   2        0    0     0     11   50    0   0 150  55
##   3    0   0   0    0   0        0    0     0     45  150    0   0 448  65
##    
##      Ms Rev Sir the Countess
##   1   0   0   1            1
##   2   1   8   0            0
##   3   1   0   0            0</code></pre>
<p>Since Don, Jonkheer, and Sir are all of similar usage, and each represent only one first-class man, I combined them into the category “Sir”. Dona, Lady, Madame, and the Countess each only represent one first-class woman, so I combined them into the category “Lady”. These values were substituted using the <code>gsub</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full$Titles &lt;- gsub(&quot;Dona|Lady|Madame|the Countess&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;, 
    full$Titles)
full$Titles &lt;- gsub(&quot;Don|Jonkheer|Sir&quot;, &quot;Sir&quot;, full$Titles)

unique(full$Titles)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;Mr&quot;     &quot;Mrs&quot;    &quot;Miss&quot;   &quot;Master&quot; &quot;Sir&quot;    &quot;Rev&quot;    &quot;Dr&quot;    
##  [8] &quot;Mme&quot;    &quot;Ms&quot;     &quot;Major&quot;  &quot;Lady&quot;   &quot;Mlle&quot;   &quot;Col&quot;    &quot;Capt&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: If you are planning to replicate the above substitution without any RegEx, make sure that you substitute “Dona” before substituting “Don”! Otherwise, “Dona” becomes “Sira” (as the “Don” part was replaced with “Sir”) and your second substitution won’t find or replace “Dona”.</p>
<p>Lastly for the titles, they should be factors, not character strings.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full$Titles &lt;- as.factor(full$Titles)</code></pre>
<p>These titles could certainly be condensed more, but for the time being, I am going to leave them separated as is.</p>
<p>I have some thoughts about wanting to split up the names further to find family groups, but since many familial relationships (cousins, nieces/nephews, aunts/uncles, fiances, mistresses, in-laws, children with a nanny or close friends) aren’t reported in any way in this data set, I’ll have to think a little longer about the most appropriate way to find actual family groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="sibsp-and-parch-for-family-size" class="section level3">
<h3>SibSp and Parch for Family Size</h3>
<p>Since the SibSp and Parch variables each give some indication as to close family members that were also aboard the ship, it would make sense to calculate family size as a combination of SibSp, Parch and the passenger in question.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full &lt;- mutate(full, FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s visualize family size</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="Bar graph showing that most families had 2 or fewer family members with them" />
<div class="figcaption">Bar graph showing that most families had 2 or fewer family members with them</div>
</div>
<p>Wow! Lots of people without immediate family with them. Perhaps these people were traveling with other family members/friends that weren’t captured in the SibSp / Parch variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="ticket-numbers-and-travel-groups" class="section level3">
<h3>Ticket Numbers and Travel Groups</h3>
<p>I’ve decided that another possible way to discern groups that were travelling together is to look at the ticket numbers. It appears that families or groups who purchased their tickets together have identical ticket numbers, thus quantifying the number of families or traveling groups. A quick look at the unique ticket numbers indicates there are 929 of them in the full data set (out of a possible 1309 passengers).</p>
<p>It seems the easiest way to separate these tickets is to create a new column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full$TravelGroup &lt;- NA</code></pre>
<p>Then arrange the data by ticket number using the <code>arrange()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full2 &lt;- arrange(full, Ticket)</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at the first few rows of results</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(full2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   PassengerId Survived Pclass

## 3          NA
## 4          NA
## 5          NA
## 6          NA</code></pre>
<p>To verify that this is working so far, I inspected the first ticket number listed (110152) on the <a href="https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-passengers-and-crew/">Titanic Passenger and Crew</a> table of Encyclopedia Titanica. That dataset lists the same three passengers owned those tickets, verified that the 3 women were traveling together, and indicated that two of the women (Miss Gladys Cherry and the Countess of Rothes) were cousins and the 3rd woman in their party (Miss Roberta Elizabeth Mary Maioni) was their servant. Looking at unique Ticket ID may be the only way to know that these women were travelling together. I’m feeling good that unique ticket numbers may be a good way to look at family/traveling groups, so full steam ahead!</p>
<p>Next, I need to generate a “TravelGroup” number. To do this, I will use the <code>transform</code> function looking for matching unique Ticket numbers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full2 &lt;- (transform(full2, TravelGroup = match(Ticket, unique(Ticket))))

# Can&#39;t forget to make those Travel Groups into factors!
full2$TravelGroup &lt;- as.factor(full2$TravelGroup)</code></pre>
<p>This generates 929 unique Travel Groups, which is the same number of unique Ticket numbers. So far so good.</p>
<p>It may also be of interest to look at group size. We can generate this using the <code>group_by()</code> and <code>mutate</code> functions in <code>dplyr</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full3 &lt;- full2 %&gt;% group_by(TravelGroup) %&gt;% mutate(GroupSize = n()) %&gt;% 
    ungroup()</code></pre>
<p>How does Travel Group Size compare to Family Group Size that we calculated earlier?</p>
<p><img src="unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" alt="Bar graph showing that most families had 2 or fewer family members with them" />
<img src="unnamed-chunk-17-2.png" alt="Bar graph showing that most travel groups had 2 or fewer members with them" /></p>
<p>They look pretty close, again showing that most people were potentially travelling alone.</p>
<p>Now to check if those with the unique Ticket IDs were really travelling alone:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filtered &lt;- filter(full3, GroupSize == 1)

# How many were listed as being onboard with siblings or
# spouses?
fSibSp &lt;- filtered[filtered$SibSp &gt; 0, ]
nrow(fSibSp)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 42</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># How many were listed as being onboard with parents or
# children?
fParch &lt;- filtered[filtered$Parch &gt; 0, ]
nrow(fParch)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 16</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># How many of those people overlapped both groups?
sum(fSibSp$PassengerId %in% fParch$PassengerId)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>Oops! Looks like we were counting 50 passengers as solo-riders when they were actually riding with family. Given the current information, I’m not sure how to know to tell who was travelling together. Manually summing SibSp and Parch to estimate family size doesn’t account for other types of groups that were travelling together and looking only at unique Ticket Number doesn’t account for some travelling with family who purchased a separate ticket. I could override the GroupSize for those 50 that weren’t actually riding solo, but their TravelGroup number won’t be accurate. For the time being, I’m going to leave TravelGroup and GroupSize as is.</p>

<p>Time to replace that NA with 8.05</p>

<p>Ok, so Passenger numbers 62 and 830 are each missing their embarkment ports. Let’s look at their class of ticket and their fare.</p>

<p>Looks like the median price for a first class ticket departing from ‘C’ (Charbourg) was 77 (in comparison to our 80). While first class tickets departing from ‘Q’ were only slightly more expensive (median price 90), only 3 first class passengers departed from that port. It seems far more likely that passengers 62 and 830 departed with the other 141 first-class passengers from Charbourg.</p>
<p>Now to replace their NA values with ‘C’. And drop any unused levels.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Assign empty embark ports to &#39;C&#39;
full4$Embarked[c(62, 830)] &lt;- &quot;C&quot;

<p>Yay! No more NA values for Embarked.</p>
</div>
<div id="missing-age" class="section level3">
<h3>Missing Age</h3>
<p>This one is a bit trickier. 263 passengers have no age listed. Taking a median age of all passengers doesn’t seem like the best way to solve this problem, so it may be easiest to try to predict the passengers’ age based on other known information.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to use the <code>caret</code> package for predicting age.</p>
<p>Generate a random forest model on the full dataset (minus the age values that are NA)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>predicted_age &lt;- train(Age ~ Pclass + Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + 
    Embarked + Titles + FamilySize + GroupSize, tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = c(2, 
    3, 7)), data = full4[!is.na(full4$Age), ], method = &quot;ranger&quot;, 
    trControl = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 10, repeats = 10, 
        verboseIter = TRUE), importance = &quot;impurity&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at what factors were the most important in modeling age:
<img src="unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" alt="Bar graph showing that Fare, the title “master”, and passenger class 3 had the highest influence on the model" /></p>
<p>Wow! Looks like it was a good idea to split out Titles!</p>
<p>Now to use this information to predict the ages of passengers with missing ages and filling in their NA values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full4$Age[is.na(full4$Age)] &lt;- predict(predicted_age, full4[is.na(full4$Age), 
    ])

# Check the summary to make sure there are no more NA values
summary(full4$Age)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    0.17   22.00   28.50   29.72   37.00   80.00</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at the age distribution of passengers with originally known ages, and the age distribution of the entire group (known and predicted ages) to make sure we didn’t terribly skew the distribution.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" alt="Histogram of the known age of passengers showing that there were few passengers below age 20, with the most passengers in their late 20s - early 30s" />

<p>Hmm, seems to have shifted a bit, but that could be due to a greater lack of age information collected for middle-aged passengers.</p>
