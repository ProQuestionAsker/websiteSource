<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>Every time there is some sort of large scale storm (e.g., blizzard or hurricane) or big sports win, I seem to hear everyone chatting about how there will be a baby boom in that area 9 months later. Driven by the curiosity to see if there was any data to back up these claims, I decided to investigate a little further. This project tells the story of my findings while allowing readers to play with the interactive graphic to answer their own questions.</p>
