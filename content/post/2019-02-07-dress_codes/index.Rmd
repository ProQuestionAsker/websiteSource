## The Premise

If you arenâ€™t currently in high school, itâ€™s probably been a while since youâ€™ve read a student handbook. The dress code section, present in about 55% of US public high schools, contains a set of hotly debated policies. They are most commonly accused of being racist, sexist, reinforcing gender stereotypes, and promoting sexualization. This is the first piece in a forthcoming series where we examine how public high schools police bodies differently and attempt to add data to each of these conversations. Here, weâ€™ll focus on the last issue: how dress codes sexualize students by analyzing the rules and their framing in 481 public high schools across the US.
