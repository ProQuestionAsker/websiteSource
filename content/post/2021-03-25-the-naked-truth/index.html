<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>There are 6,816 foundation shades on Sephora &amp; Ultaâ€™s websites. Looking at how all of those shades are named revealed something many people of color already knew: the beauty industry is full of microaggressions &amp; anti-Black bias. This project was a deep dive into the types of names assigned to various shades of foundation in two of the biggest beauty retailers in the US.</p>
