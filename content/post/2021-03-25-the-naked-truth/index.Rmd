## The Premise

There are 6,816 foundation shades on Sephora & Ulta's websites. Looking at how all of those shades are named revealed something many people of color already knew: the beauty industry is full of microaggressions & anti-Black bias. This project was a deep dive into the types of names assigned to various shades of foundation in two of the biggest beauty retailers in the US.
