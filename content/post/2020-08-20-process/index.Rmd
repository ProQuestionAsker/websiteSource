## The Premise

I had been proposing that our team create a "failure blog" for quite a while. The general idea was to share with the world that, although we create complex and polished stories for the internet, we routinely cull ideas or drastically change them before they make it to the public eye. I wanted to help normalize that it's ok if your original idea for a data or research project doesn't work out. 

This blog post helped to detail the steps that The Pudding team follows when writing stories.
